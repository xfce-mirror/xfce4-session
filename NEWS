- Implement support for the RestartImmediately restart style hint.
- Fix possible crash with uninitialised GError (bug 4202).
- Link libxfsm against all required libs to avoid link-time errors
  (bug 4429).

- Add SaveSession kiosk capability (bug 2998).
- When a client requests interaction, don't continue to kill all other
  clients while it's still interacting.  And then don't ignore it when
  it wants to cancel shutdown.  Also fixes a similar problem when
  interaction is requested during a phase 2 save-yourself (bug 4284).

  a new one (bug 3007).

  error from xfdesktop if the session bus is not configured properly (#2447).
- Applications that fail to startup on login do no longer time out, but are
  dropped immediately from the session, which results in faster startup in
  that case.
- Merge the sudo and the HAL shutdown helpers into a single shutdown helper,
  which tries to use HAL first, and falls back to sudo.
- Drop GLib 2.2.x compatibility code.
- Updated translations: Pau Rul-lan Ferragut (ca), Sylvain Vedrenne (eo),
			ByungHyun Choi (ko), Phan Vĩnh Thịnh (vi)
- New translations: Sonam Rinchen (dz)

  items from the previous location (~/Desktop/Autostart/) will be migrated
  automatically on first run of the new session manager.
- The list of autostarted applications can now be altered using a simple
  editor application (xfce4-autostart-editor).
- The xfce4-tips tool is now part of xfce4-session and well integrated with
  the new autostart mechanism.
