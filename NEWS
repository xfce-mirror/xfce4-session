4.3.99.2
========
- Remove references to xftaskbar4 and xfce4-iconbox and rename xffm to Thunar
  for the Tips'n'Tricks displayed on startup (#1332).
- Be sure to start Thunar prior to xfdesktop on first login to avoid the trash
  error from xfdesktop if the session bus is not configured properly (#2447).
- Applications that fail to startup on login do no longer time out, but are
  dropped immediately from the session, which results in faster startup in
  that case.
- Merge the sudo and the HAL shutdown helpers into a single shutdown helper,
  which tries to use HAL first, and falls back to sudo.
- Drop GLib 2.2.x compatibility code.

  explicitly using --with-shutdown-style=hal to configure (Bug #2046).
- Do not try to save the xfce4-tips as part of the session (Bug #1089).
- Add shutdown/reboot support for Solaris (Bug #2230, Moinak Ghosh).
- Drop libgnome dependency for assistive technologies support.


4.3.90.2
========
- Update dialogs to use the new XfceTitledDialog.
- Properly handle OnlyShowIn and NotShowIn in the autostart editor.
- Run discard command when client terminates unexpectedly.


4.3.90.1
========
- Use the new standard location ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/autostart/) to specify
  applications that will be automatically start on session login. Autostart
  items from the previous location (~/Desktop/Autostart/) will be migrated
  automatically on first run of the new session manager.
- The list of autostarted applications can now be altered using a simple
  editor application (xfce4-autostart-editor).
- The xfce4-tips tool is now part of xfce4-session and well integrated with
  the new autostart mechanism.
