.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B xfce4-session
command.
.PP
The \fBxfce4-session\fP program starts up the Xfce Desktop Environment and
is typically executed by your login manager (e.g. xdm, gdm, kdm, wdm or from
your X startup scripts). It will load your last session or a default session
that includes the standard Xfce programs if no saved session is available.

\fBxfce4-session\fP is an standard X11R6 session manager that can manage
any X11R6 SM compliant program, including GNOME and KDE programs.

\fBxfce4-session\fP uses the contents of the ~/.cache/sessions/ directory
for starting previously saved sessions.

\fBxfce4-session\fP takes the following command line options:
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-tcp
Disable binding to TCP ports in the ICE layer. This is not possible on every
platform. If you use this option on a platform that does not support it,
\fBxfce4-session\fP will print a warning message and ignore the setting.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a help screen and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-version
